# Power BI Finance Dashboard

This is a Power BI project I created to analyze financial performance across products, customer segments, and countries. The dashboard provides a clear, interactive view of key metrics like sales, profit, and discounts—making it easier for business users to understand what’s working and where improvements can be made.
